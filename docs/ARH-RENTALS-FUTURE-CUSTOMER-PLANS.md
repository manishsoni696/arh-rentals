## 1) Purpose of This File
This file exists to:
- Preserve future pricing ideas
- Avoid confusion later
- Keep startup phase simple
- Prevent accidental early implementation

---

## 2) Customer Type Covered Here
This file is ONLY for:

➡️ **Rent Seeker / Customer**  
(जो property rent पर लेना चाहता है)

❌ Owner / Property Poster plans are NOT included here.

---

## 3) Core Future Strategy (Locked Concept)

### 3.1 Area-Based Unlock (Micro Area Only)
- Customer will **NOT unlock entire city**
- Customer will **NOT unlock full pincode**
- Unlock will be limited to:
  - 1 Micro Area (Sector / Colony / Market)

Example:
- Pincode: 125001
- Area: Sector 14
- Unlock applies ONLY to Sector 14

---

### 3.2 Limited Property Count Unlock
In any future plan:
- ❌ Unlimited properties unlock will NEVER exist
- ✅ Only limited count allowed

Possible slabs:
- 1 property
- 5 properties
- 10 properties

---

### 3.3 Residential & Commercial Separation
- Residential and Commercial plans will ALWAYS be separate
- No mixed unlock allowed

---

## 4) Indicative Future Plans (NOT ACTIVE)

### 4.1 Residential – Future Ideas
| Plan Price | Area Scope | Properties Unlock | Validity |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| ₹29 | 1 Micro Area | 1 Property | 24 hrs |

## 5) Rules That Will Always Apply (Locked)

- 1 plan = 1 micro area only
- Properties unlock count is capped
- Residential & Commercial cannot be mixed
- No city-wide or pincode-wide unlock
- No lifetime unlocks
- No unlimited browsing

---

## 6) Startup Phase Reminder
During startup phase:
- Only **single-property unlock plans** are active
- Minimum pricing starts from:
  - ₹29 Residential
  - ₹49 Commercial
- This file must NOT be used for live pricing

---

## 7) Developer / AI Instruction
⚠️ DO NOT:
- Implement these plans without explicit confirmation
- Assume these plans are live
- Merge this logic with startup plans

This file is for **future roadmap reference only**.
