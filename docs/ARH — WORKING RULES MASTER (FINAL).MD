🔐 ARH — WORKING RULES MASTER (FINAL v2.1)

⚠️ THIS IS A HARD RULEBOOK

This document defines exactly how work must be done on ARH / ARH Rentals projects.
Any chat, AI, or developer MUST follow this word-by-word.

If there is any confusion, THIS FILE OVERRIDES EVERYTHING.

1️⃣ COMMUNICATION & FLOW RULES (MANDATORY)

✅ SINGLE CHAT only
❌ No multiple expert chats
❌ No master-controller system
❌ No parallel problem solving

✅ One task at a time
✅ One step at a time

Working sequence rule:

Finish → Verify → Lock → Move to next

If multiple issues exist:
→ Solve sequentially, NEVER together

2️⃣ TEACHING & EXPLANATION STYLE (OWNER PREFERENCE — 🔒 LOCKED)

This is CRITICAL.

✅ Explain ONE STEP at a time
❌ Never dump multiple steps together
❌ Never assume previous steps are done
✅ Wait for explicit CONFIRM / DONE before next step

If the owner says “KUCH SAMAJH NHI AYA”:
→ Restart explanation in simpler, smaller steps
→ No ego, no rushing

3️⃣ CODE DELIVERY RULES (VERY STRICT)

❌ NEVER write raw code in normal chat text

✅ ALL code must be inside ONE clear paste box

REQUIRED FORMAT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

----------------------------
PASTE THIS CODE:
<code only, nothing else>
----------------------------

PASTE LOCATION (TEXT ONLY):
- File name
- Exact section / exact line / exact selector
- Add / Replace / Delete (clearly mentioned)


ABSOLUTE RULES

❌ No explanation inside code
❌ No mixed text + code
❌ No “paste here somewhere” type instructions

If NO code is required, reply ONLY:

NO CODE CHANGE REQUIRED

4️⃣ FILE & ARCHITECTURE SAFETY RULES

By default:

❌ NO deletions
❌ NO restructuring
❌ NO renaming files
❌ NO changing architecture

Allowed ONLY unless explicitly approved:

✅ Additions
✅ Improvements
✅ Polishing

🧨 DELETION RULE (SPECIAL — 🔒)

If something must be deleted:

AI must announce deletion FIRST

Explain WHY

Get explicit approval

Then and only then → delete

5️⃣ ONE FILE RULE (STRICT)

✅ ONE STEP = ONE FILE

❌ Never give multiple files in one step
❌ Never mix HTML + CSS + JS together

Examples:

Step = listings/index.html → ONLY that file

Step = styles.css → ONLY that file

6️⃣ RESPONSIVENESS (NON-NEGOTIABLE — 🔒 HARD LOCK)

THIS RULE WAS RECONFIRMED AND HARD-LOCKED IN THIS SESSION

Every single change MUST work on:

📱 Mobile
📟 Tablet
💻 Desktop

If responsiveness is not verified:
→ Task is INVALID

This rule is automatic, permanent, and does not need repetition.

7️⃣ PERFORMANCE & BLOAT RULES

❌ No unnecessary CSS duplication
❌ No heavy JS
❌ No animation abuse
❌ No framework injection

Guideline:

Clean CSS > Smart layout > Minimum JS

8️⃣ SEO & CONTENT RULES

❌ No SEO unless explicitly asked
❌ No keyword stuffing
❌ No schema, backlinks, hacks unless approved

When SEO is requested:

✅ Clean
✅ Minimal
✅ Logical
✅ Long-term safe

9️⃣ BUSINESS LANGUAGE RULES (CRITICAL)

🚫 FORBIDDEN WORDS (ANYWHERE)

verified

guaranteed

assured

trusted (promise sense)

confirmed tenant

✅ MANDATORY POSITIONING

No broker

No mediator

No responsibility for deals

Applies to:

🔟 OTP & AUTH RULES (🔒 LOCKED)

OTP = login/session confirmation only
❌ OTP ≠ verification

Default rules:

OTP validity: 5 minutes

Resend cooldown: 60 seconds

Max OTP: 3 in 4 hours

Max wrong attempts: 5

Block duration: 15 minutes (progressive)

Session rule:

Same device + active session → NO OTP
PIN login allowed

1️⃣1️⃣ PRICING & PLANS RULES

1 plan = 1 property
Multiple properties = multiple plans

❌ No lifetime plans
❌ No unlimited listings

Expiry = listing hidden

Any future plans MUST be marked:

REFERENCE ONLY — NOT ACTIVE

1️⃣2️⃣ UI / UX RULES

Premium SaaS feel
No clutter
No oversized elements
Balanced spacing
Clear hierarchy

If owner says:

“LOOK ACHI NHI LAG RHI”
→ Fix is MANDATORY, debate not allowed.

🆕 1️⃣3️⃣ STABILITY OVER POLISH RULE (ADDED THIS SESSION — 🔒)

If a feature is:

Functionally stable

Business-safe

Usable on Desktop + Tablet + Mobile

Then:

❌ Micro-alignment / cosmetic perfection is NOT mandatory immediately
✅ Such improvements may be explicitly deferred
✅ Stability > premature polish

This rule prevents unnecessary churn and regression.

🆕 1️⃣4️⃣ SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH RULE (JS / CSS) — 🔒

For critical systems (e.g. Mobile NAV, Pricing selection):

There must be ONLY ONE active logic source

Duplicate “fix blocks” are NOT allowed long-term

Temporary duplication may exist only until cleanup phase

Final logic must be locked and documented

1️⃣5️⃣ DECISION AUTHORITY (FINAL)

Business logic = OWNER FINAL

AI must:

Ask before assuming

Never override business intent

Never force “best practice” against owner’s rule

1️⃣6️⃣ CHANGE MEMORY & TRANSFER RULE

Any confirmed working style
Any approved execution pattern

→ Must be remembered and transferred to:

New chat

New task

New phase

✅ FINAL STATEMENT

All future chats
