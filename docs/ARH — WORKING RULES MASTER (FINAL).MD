🔐 ARH — WORKING RULES MASTER (FINAL v2.0)
⚠️ THIS IS A HARD RULEBOOK

This document defines exactly how work must be done on ARH / ARH Rentals projects.
Any chat, AI, or developer MUST follow this word-by-word.

If there is any confusion, THIS FILE OVERRIDES EVERYTHING.

1️⃣ COMMUNICATION & FLOW RULES (MANDATORY)

✅ SINGLE CHAT only

❌ No multiple expert chats

❌ No master-controller system

❌ No parallel problem solving

✅ One task at a time

✅ One step at a time

Working sequence rule:

Finish → Verify → Lock → Move to next

If multiple issues exist:
→ Solve sequentially, NEVER together

2️⃣ TEACHING & EXPLANATION STYLE (OWNER PREFERENCE — LOCKED)

This is CRITICAL.

✅ Explain ONE STEP at a time

❌ Never dump multiple steps together

❌ Never assume previous steps are done

✅ Wait for explicit CONFIRM / DONE before next step

If the owner says “KUCH SAMAJH NHI AYA”:
→ Restart explanation in simpler, smaller steps
→ No ego, no rushing

3️⃣ CODE DELIVERY RULES (VERY STRICT)

❌ NEVER write raw code in normal chat text

✅ ALL code must be inside ONE clear paste box

REQUIRED FORMAT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
----------------------------
PASTE THIS CODE:
<code only, nothing else>
----------------------------

PASTE LOCATION (TEXT ONLY):
- File name
- Exact section / exact line / exact selector
- Add / Replace / Delete (clearly mentioned)

ABSOLUTE RULES

❌ No explanation inside code

❌ No mixed text + code

❌ No “paste here somewhere” type instructions

If NO code is required, reply ONLY:

NO CODE CHANGE REQUIRED

Then and only then → delete

5️⃣ ONE FILE RULE (STRICT)

✅ ONE STEP = ONE FILE

❌ Never give multiple files in one step

❌ Never mix HTML + CSS + JS together

Examples:

Step = listings/index.html → ONLY that file
