🔐 ARH RENTALS — NEXT DAY STARTING POINT (v1.0)

Purpose:
This file defines exactly where to resume work tomorrow without confusion, re-discussion, or re-checking locked items.

🧭 CURRENT PROJECT STATE (AS OF TODAY)

Overall Status:
🟢 UI & CORE FLOW STABLE
🟡 SEO & Backend NOT started (intentionally)

Website is NOT frozen, but UI changes must now be intentional & minimal.

🔒 WHAT IS LOCKED (DO NOT REOPEN TOMORROW)

❌ Do NOT revisit unless broken:

OTP logic (frontend + backend)

Pricing card selection logic

Pricing plans & copy

Legal page content

Post Property flow (PIN → OTP → Plan)

Header / Nav / Mobile menu behavior

Home page structure

Listings page UI (filters + layout)

👉 Treat these as READ-ONLY.

✅ LAST COMPLETED TASK (TODAY)

Listings Page UI

Filters: City / Area / Property Type / Max Rent

Sorting removed

“Search Properties” CTA added (UI only)

“Unlock Details” controlled with future-safe text

Mobile + Tablet + Desktop verified

Status: ✅ DONE & FROZEN

▶️ WHERE TO START TOMORROW (STEP-BY-STEP)
🔹 STEP 1 (MANDATORY – START HERE)

Full UI Freeze Confirmation

No new UI ideas

No design changes

No wording tweaks

📌 Objective:
Confirm → UI is final for v1 launch

🔹 STEP 2 (PRIMARY TASK)
SEO PHASE — START
A) Google Search Console (GSC)

Verify property status

Check:

Pages indexed

Errors / warnings

Sitemap status (if any)

❗ No code changes yet.

B) On-Page SEO Review (SAFE ONLY)

Titles

Meta descriptions

H1 usage

Internal links

⚠️ Rules:

No keyword stuffing

No schema

No backlinks

No content rewrite unless critical

🔹 STEP 3 (OPTIONAL — ONLY IF ASKED)

Performance sanity check

Page load

Image sizes

Obvious blocking issues

(No Lighthouse obsession)

⛔ WHAT NOT TO DO TOMORROW

❌ No backend coding
❌ No API integration
❌ No unlock logic
❌ No dashboard
❌ No analytics
❌ No feature ideas

Those are future phases.

🧠 WORKING RULES (REMINDER)

ONE task at a time

ONE file at a time

Paste-box format only if code is required

Mobile + Tablet + Desktop always

If unsure → STOP and ASK

🏁 TOMORROW’S FIRST MESSAGE SHOULD BE
