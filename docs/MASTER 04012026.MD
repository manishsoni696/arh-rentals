🔐 ARH RENTALS — MASTER SYSTEM & BUSINESS REFERENCE

Last Updated: Jan 2026

1️⃣ PROJECT IDENTITY

Project Name: ARH Rentals
Brand: ARH Rentals (by Anjani Real Heights)
Website: https://rent.anjanirealheights.com

Owner Company: Anjani Real Heights
Location Focus: Hisar (Phase-1 only)

Nature:
A rental advertisement / information-access platform
👉 NOT a broker
👉 NOT a mediator
👉 NOT a verifier

2️⃣ CORE BUSINESS MODEL (⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT)
🔴 ZERO RESPONSIBILITY MODEL (LOCKED)

ARH Rentals ONLY publishes rental ads.

We:

❌ Do NOT verify property

❌ Do NOT verify owner

❌ Do NOT verify tenant

❌ Do NOT verify documents

❌ Do NOT guarantee deal success

❌ Do NOT guarantee tenant availability

❌ Do NOT guarantee lead quality

❌ Do NOT guarantee response / calls / conversions

⚠️ STRICT WORD BAN (GLOBAL RULE)

❌ NEVER use these words anywhere on website or content:

Verified

Trusted

Approved

Guaranteed

Assured

Confirmed

Safe Deal

✔ Allowed wording:

Owner-posted

Advertisement

Listing platform

Information access only

Users must verify independently

3️⃣ DISCLAIMER (MANDATORY EVERYWHERE)

Use this logic everywhere (home, listings, pricing, legal):

ARH Rentals is an information-access platform only.
Property details are posted directly by owners.
Users must independently verify all details before any transaction.
ARH Rentals does not guarantee tenant availability or deal success.

4️⃣ USER TYPES
A) PROPERTY OWNER (Poster)

Owner posts property ads

Each property requires a separate paid plan

Same phone number posting 2 properties ⇒ 2 payments required

B) TENANT / SEEKER (Viewer)

Browses listings

Contact unlock / details unlock = future paid feature

Must verify property themselves

5️⃣ PLANS & PRICING (LOCKED)

Plans are PROPERTY-LEVEL (NOT user-level)

Plan	Price	Validity	Listings
Basic	₹199	15 days	1 property
Premium	₹349	30 days	1 property
Pro	₹599	60 days	1 property

Rules:

❗ 1 plan = 1 property

❗ Same phone, second property = new payment

❗ Expiry hides listing automatically

6️⃣ LISTING EXPIRY & DELETE POLICY (LOCKED)

Plan expires

Listing becomes hidden (not visible to users)

Soft delete (deleted_at)

Hard delete after buffer (7–15 days) — future decision

7️⃣ OTP LOGIN SYSTEM (CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED)
Purpose

OTP is ONLY for login/session, not verification.

What OTP DOES:

Confirms phone ownership

Creates session token

Allows posting flow later

What OTP DOES NOT:

❌ Verify owner

❌ Verify property

❌ Approve listing

❌ Guarantee authenticity

8️⃣ OTP FLOW (SUMMARY)

Backend: Cloudflare Worker

Steps:

1️⃣4️⃣ CODING INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEW CHAT
