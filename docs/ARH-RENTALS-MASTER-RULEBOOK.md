# 🔐 ARH RENTALS — MASTER SNAPSHOT (PASTE THIS IN EVERY NEW CHAT)

Last Updated: Jan 6, 2026  
Timezone: Asia/Kolkata

---

## 0) OVERALL GOAL (NON-NEGOTIABLE — 🔒 LOCKED)
- Website visually premium
- Fast load (no bloat, no over-engineering)
- SEO-friendly **ONLY when explicitly asked**
- Mobile + Tablet + Desktop PERFECT (🔒 LOCKED FOREVER)
- No technical compromise at any layer

---

## 1) WORKING RULES (🔒 LOCKED — MUST FOLLOW)
- One task at a time (sequential fixes only)
- One step = one file = one paste box
- Code must be given ONLY inside a copy-paste box (no explanation inside code)
- After code box, write ONLY:
  - PASTE LOCATION (TEXT ONLY): file name + exact section + action (replace/add)
- If no code required: **NO CODE CHANGE REQUIRED**
- No inline CSS (use shared stylesheet only) unless explicitly approved
- Keep structure stable: **ONLY additions & improvements** (no random rewrites)
- Always ensure all changes work on Desktop + Tablet + Mobile

---

## 2) PROJECT STATUS (CURRENT)
- 🔒 Core System: STABLE & LOCKED
- 🟡 Listings UI: FINALIZATION IN PROGRESS (ACTIVE WORK ZONE)
- 🟠 styles.css: FUNCTIONAL but has DUPLICATE blocks (cleanup needed later, **only after final fixes**)
- 🟡 Area / Sector input UX upgrade: ACTIVE
- 🟡 Pricing CSS “Final Lock” placement: needs END-OF-FILE (pending)
- ⏳ SEO + Backend planning: DEFERRED (DO NOT TOUCH unless asked)

---

## 3) FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT (OWNER COMMUNICATION — PLANNED)
When a property owner lists a property:
- Owner should receive a confirmation message: “Your property is listed on our website”
- Terms & Conditions should NOT be sent fully in message
- Use link in SMS/WhatsApp/email pointing to T&C page

Future (later decision):
- If property status changes (e.g., RENTED), notify owner
- Before listing expiry, send reminder to renew
- If not renewed, listing auto-removes
- Renewal option should exist for that owner’s property

---

## 4) CURRENT SEO STATE (IMPORTANT)
- SEO is only to be done when explicitly requested
- Only ONE H1 per page
- Clean title + meta description when asked
- No keyword stuffing, no schema unless asked

---

## 5) WHAT TO PASTE IN THIS CHAT (IMPORTANT)
DO NOT ask for full project code.

Ask only for:
- File name(s) involved
- The relevant section (or 80–200 lines around the issue)
- Expected outcome + screenshot if UI issue

Then provide:
- Exact patch in paste box
- Exact paste location

---

## 6) PENDING TASKS (SHORT LIST — CURRENT)
1) Listings UI finalization (active zone)
2) Area / Sector input UX upgrade (active)
3) styles.css duplicate blocks cleanup (later, after final fix)
4) Pricing CSS “final lock” placement at END-OF-FILE (pending)
5) Owner notification + renewal/expiry reminder system (planned, later scope)

---

## 7) OPTIONAL: QUICK CONTEXT (ARH)
Project: ARH Rentals (Anjani Real Heights)  
Primary focus: Rental listings + premium UI + fast load  
Rules: locked execution format + responsive always
